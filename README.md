# Pre-trained-Image-Classifier

**Project Goal**
The primary objective of this project is to enhance programming skills using Python by implementing an image classifier to identify dog breeds. Participants in a citywide dog show will submit images of their dogs along with biographical information. The classifier's task is to verify if the submitted images are of dogs and correctly classify the breed if applicable.

**Description**

This project involves using a pre-trained image classifier in Python to determine whether submitted images are of dogs or other pets. The classifier utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet architectures, pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.

**Tasks**

**Identify Dogs:** Utilize Python skills to determine the most effective image classification algorithm for distinguishing between images of dogs and those of other pets.
**Classify Dog Breeds:** Evaluate the classifier's performance in correctly identifying the breed of dogs from the images submitted.
**Evaluate CNN Architectures:** Compare the performance of AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet architectures to determine which one best meets the project's objectives.
**Optimize for Time:** Consider the computational time required by each algorithm and assess whether a slightly less accurate but faster solution might be preferable depending on the context.

**Important Notes**
The project utilizes CNNs, which excel in image classification tasks by recognizing patterns and features in images.
The provided classifier function (classifier.py) supports the implementation of AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet for image classification.
Similar-looking dog breeds pose challenges; the classifier may struggle with fine distinctions between breeds like Great Pyrenees and Kuvasz.

**Principal Objectives**
**Identification:** Accurately determine if images depict dogs or other animals.
**Breed Classification:** Correctly classify the breed of dogs shown in images.
**Optimal CNN Selection:**Assess which CNN architecture (AlexNet, VGG, or ResNet) best fulfills the identification and classification objectives.
**Time Efficiency:** Balance accuracy against computational efficiency to determine the most suitable solution for the task.
